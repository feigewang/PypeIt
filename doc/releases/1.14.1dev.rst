Version 1.14.1dev
=================

Dependency Changes

- Removes use of deprecated ``pkg_resources``.

Functionality/Performance Improvements and Additions
----------------------------------------------------

- Started the development of instrument-specific scattered light removal. In this

Instrument-specific Updates
---------------------------

Script Changes
--------------

- When making datacubes, the user can select a separate frame to use for the sky subtraction.
  In this case, it is the processed data that will be used for sky subtraction (akin to nodding).

Under-the-hood Improvements
---------------------------

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed bug associated with finding more than one file with the same name (but
  presumably different extensions).
- Fixed a bug associated with an incorrect date for the transition to the Mark4
  detector for Keck/LRIS RED.
