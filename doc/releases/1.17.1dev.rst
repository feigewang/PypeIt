Version 1.17.1dev
=================

Installation Changes
--------------------



Dependency Changes
------------------


Functionality/Performance Improvements and Additions
----------------------------------------------------

- The WCS for datacubes now adopts the convention of North
  is up and East is left. In previous version of PypeIt,
  East was right.

Instrument-specific Updates
---------------------------


Script Changes
--------------

- Added ``pypeit_run_to_calibstep`` to run PypeIt to an input calibration
  step. This script is useful to re-generate calibration files for a given
  configuration without running the full reduction.


Datamodel Changes
-----------------



Under-the-hood Improvements
---------------------------


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix the WCS for the datacube generation. There was an offset
  in both spatial dimensions equal to half the field of view.
- Fix the code for the extraction of the 1D flat spectrum, so that
  the spectrum is extracted even when `pixelflat_model` does not exist.
