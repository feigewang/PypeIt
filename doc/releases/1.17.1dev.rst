=================

Installation Changes
--------------------



Dependency Changes
------------------


Functionality/Performance Improvements and Additions
----------------------------------------------------

- The WCS for datacubes now adopts the convention of North
  is up and East is left. In previous version of PypeIt,
  East was right.
- The spatial flexure can now take a constant value for every slit, independent values for each slit,
  or independent values for each slit edge.

Instrument-specific Updates
---------------------------


Script Changes
--------------

Datamodel Changes
-----------------

- Spatial flexure is now stored as a 2D numpy array.

Under-the-hood Improvements
---------------------------


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix the WCS for the datacube generation. There was an offset
  in both spatial dimensions equal to half the field of view.
