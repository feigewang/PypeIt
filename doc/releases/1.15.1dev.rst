Bug Fixes

- The subpixel algorithm used to resample datacubes that are generated by `pypeit_coadd_datacube`
  produced error cubes that were not properly propagating the noise. The error cubes of the NGP
  algorithm were unaffected. The error cubes are now regularly inspected with vet tests to ensure
  the error cubes are reliable.
