Version 1.16.1dev
=================

Installation Changes
--------------------

- Significant expansion of PypeIt's use of the cache system; see
  :ref:`data_installation`.  Important changes include that most cached files
  are now version dependent.  When upgrading to new versions of PypeIt, users
  should delete their cache and start fresh.

Dependency Changes
------------------

- Support added for numpy>=2.0.0; numpy<=2.0.0 should still be supported

Functionality/Performance Improvements and Additions
----------------------------------------------------

- Added the possibility to decide if the extracted standard star spectrum should be
  used as a crutch for tracing the object in the science frame (before it was done as default).
  This is done by setting the parameter ``use_std_trace`` in FindObjPar.
- Now PypeIt can handle the case where "Standard star trace does not match the number of orders in the echelle data"
  both in `run_pypeit` and in `pypeit_coadd_1dspec`.

Instrument-specific Updates
---------------------------

- Updated X-Shooter detector gain and read noise to come from header, and
  updated plate scales to the most recent values from the manual.  Detailed
  changes are:
    - NIR arm:
        - Platescale updated from 0.197 to 0.245 arcsec/pixel
        - Dark current updated from 0. to 72. e-/pixel/hr
        - Gain updated from 2.12 to 2.29 e-/DN
    - VIS arm:
        - Platescale updated from an order-dependent value, to being 0.245
          arcsec/pixel for all orders


Script Changes
--------------

- Modifications to the cache-related :ref:`install_scripts` to accommodate
  expansion of and changes to the cache system.
- Added ``pypeit_clean_cache`` script to facilitate both viewing and removing
  files in the cache.
- A new script, called `pypeit_extract_datacube`, allows 1D spectra of point
  sources to be extracted from datacubes.
- The sensitivity function is now generated outside of datacube generation.
- The `grating_corr` column is now used to select the correct grating
  correction file for each spec2d file when generating the datacube.
- Added the ``--extr`` parameter in the ``pypeit_sensfunc`` script (also as a SensFuncPar)
  to allow the user to specify the extraction method to use when computing the sensitivity
  function (before only optimal extraction was used).

Datamodel Changes
-----------------

Under-the-hood Improvements
---------------------------

- Introduced :class:`~pypeit.pypeitdata.PypeItDataPaths` to handle all
  interactions with the ``pypeit/data`` directory, which provides a unified
  interface for accessing on-disk and cached files.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix "The system cannot find the file specified" errors when installing on Windows.
- Fixed a fault caused when all frames in a pypeit file are identified as being
  part of ``all`` calibration groups.
- Allow for empty 2D wavecal solution in HDU extension of WaveCalib file
- Fixed a bug in the ginga display function, when the user doesn't provide the `trc_name` argument.
- Fix a MAJOR BUT SUBTLE bug in the use of ``numpy.argsort``. When using ``numpy.argsort``
  the parameter kind='stable' should be used to ensure that a sorting algorithm more robust
  than "quicksort" is used.
